<p>Paper medical history records end up in files,
on the shelves. Nobody looks at them until it is time for the patientâ€™s next visit.
 Paper based records can not be easily searched and analyzed across the board or in large numbers.
  It is not easy or economically feasible to discover trends and find unmet needs.
  As a result, many practices have patients with additional needs
  who can be served but there is no way to proactively contact and offer them additional relevant services
  they might be interested in.</p>
